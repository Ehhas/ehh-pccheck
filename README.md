# ehh-pccheck

If you suspect some player is using illegal game modifications you can use this script to freeze his inputs and ask him to come and do a pc check.
You can make it in the config if either the time for the player runs out or he leaves in the middle of the pc check he will get instantly banned by your selected anticheat.
There are inbuild logs you just need to set a webhook config_server.lua file and it will log everything.

## commands

pccheck [playerID]
pccheckcancel [playerID]
